# VPC Simulator

## Overview

The VPC Simulator is an interactive web-based tool designed to help you visualize and manage virtual private cloud concepts with ease. **Please note, this is not a real private cloud but a learning tool that gives you an experience of how to use one.** The simulator allows you to create and manage VPCs, configure subnets, routing tables, and security groups, helping you understand how networking works in the cloud in a safe, interactive environment.

This platform is completely free to use for educational purposes and personal projects.

## Key Features

* **VPC Creation:** Effortlessly create and manage your own Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).
* **Subnet Management:** Add and manage subnets to define the structure of your network.
* **Routing Tables:** Visualize and configure routing tables to control traffic flow within your VPC.
* **Security Groups:** Define and manage security groups to control access to your resources.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Experience an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface for cloud network management.
* **Real-Time Visualizations:** Get a clear picture of your network with dynamic visualizations.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to start simulating your cloud network:

1.  **Register:** Create a new account on the [Register page] (register.html).
2.  **Login:** Use your new credentials to log in on the [Login page] (login.html).
3.  **Dashboard:** Access your personalized dashboard to manage all your network configurations.
4.  **Create a VPC:** Go to the [Create VPC page] (create_vpc.html) to define your first VPC by providing a name and a CIDR block.
5.  **Add Subnets:** Once your VPC is created, you can add new subnets to it on the [Add Subnet page] (add_subnet.html).

## Future Enhancements (Coming Soon)

We are continuously working to improve the VPC Simulator. Here are some of the features currently in development:

* **Peering Connections:** Connect different VPCs for cross-VPC communication.
* **VPN Connections:** Securely connect your VPC to on-premises networks.
* **Direct Connect:** Build a dedicated network connection between your data center and your VPC.
* **Load Balancers:** Automatically distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure high availability and performance.
